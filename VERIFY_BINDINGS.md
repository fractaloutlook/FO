# Verify Module Bindings

## Quick Check: Are the New Bindings Generated?

Run these commands to verify the cursor tracking functionality was added:

```bash
# Check if bindings exist
ls -la ~/FO/src/module_bindings/

# Look for mouse_state table and update_mouse_state reducer
grep -i "mouse" ~/FO/src/module_bindings/index.ts

# Check for the new table in the tables section
grep -A 5 -B 5 "mouse_state" ~/FO/src/module_bindings/index.ts

# Check for the new reducer in the reducers section  
grep -A 5 -B 5 "update_mouse_state" ~/FO/src/module_bindings/index.ts
```

## Expected Output

You should see:
- ✅ `mouse_state` table in the tables section
- ✅ `update_mouse_state` reducer in the reducers section
- ✅ `MouseState` type definition

## Next Steps

If the bindings look good:

1. **Test your React app** - Visit your site and check for cursor tracking
2. **Open multiple browser tabs** - Move your mouse around to see other cursors
3. **Check console** - Should be no more TypeScript errors

## Success Criteria

- ✅ No `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'rowType')` errors
- ✅ Cursor tracking works (multiple tabs show mouse movements)
- ✅ Chat functionality still works
- ✅ Admin controls still work
