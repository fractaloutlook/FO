Project Status: Transparent Business Landing Page
Timestamp: January 23, 2025, 2:58 PM CST
Duration: ~18 hours into 24-hour challenge

Initial Situation:
We began with a concept for creating a transparent, anti-scam business website that would document the process of attempting to make $25 online. The project started as a reaction to discovering predatory marketing practices in online business courses.

Repository History and Corrections:
We initially created a new repository (FO) but accidentally integrated it with the existing portfolio site (fractaloutlook.github.io). We had to carefully separate these projects and restore the portfolio site's functionality. After fixing this, we properly established the FO repository as the home for this project.

Current Technical Setup:
The project uses a React-based stack with Vite as the build tool. We've implemented:
- Basic UI components using simplified versions of shadcn/ui
- A landing page with a timestamp counter
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- Vite configuration with the correct base URL (/FO/)

Domain Configuration:
- Domain: fractaloutlook.com
- DNS Configuration: Four GitHub Pages A records implemented
- HTTPS: Currently being provisioned
- Previous GoDaddy parking configuration removed
- CNAME record pointing to fractaloutlook.github.io

Current Status:
- Build pipeline is working (successful GitHub Actions deployment)
- Domain DNS changes are propagating
- HTTPS certificate is being provisioned
- Landing page is built but not yet accessible

Timeline Status:
Started at approximately 8:10 PM CST on January 22, 2025
Current goal is to achieve first sale within 24 hours (by 8:10 PM CST January 23, 2025)
~18 hours elapsed (including overnight pause)
~5 hours remaining for monetization and marketing

Critical Next Steps for 5-Hour Window:
1. Verify HTTPS provisioning completes
2. Implement fastest possible payment processing solution
3. Define minimum viable product/service
4. Execute rapid marketing strategy

Technical Debt/Issues to Address:
- Need to verify all component imports are working
- May need to adjust deployment settings once site is live
- Should implement error boundaries and loading states
- Need to set up proper monitoring for the GitHub Actions workflow

Given the compressed remaining timeline, the focus must shift immediately to implementing a payment solution and defining a deliverable product. The technical foundation is laid, but monetization needs to happen within the next 5 hours to meet the 24-hour goal.
