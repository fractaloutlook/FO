    <h1>SpacetimeDB on Oracle Cloud Free Tier</h1>
    <p>This guide walks you through setting up SpacetimeDB on Oracle Cloud's Free Tier using Ubuntu 22.04. We'll connect to your VM, install all necessary components, and get SpacetimeDB up and running.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An Oracle Cloud account with Free Tier access</li>
        <li>A created Ubuntu 22.04 VM instance (with 2 CPUs, 12GB RAM)</li>
        <li>The VM's public IP address</li>
        <li>The SSH private key downloaded from Oracle</li>
        <li>Windows 10 or 11 with Command Prompt or PowerShell</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 1: Connect to Your VM Using SSH</h2>
    <div class="step">
        <p>Windows 10 and 11 include OpenSSH by default, allowing you to connect directly from Command Prompt or PowerShell without additional software like PuTTY.</p>

        <h3>Using the SSH Command</h3>
        <p>Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and use the following command, replacing the placeholders with your specific information:</p>
        
        <pre>ssh -i "C:\path\to\your\private.key" ubuntu@YOUR-VM-IP-ADDRESS</pre>
        
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre>ssh -i "C:\Users\USER\My Documents\oracle\newdualsys.key" ubuntu@64.181.202.3</pre>
        
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> The first time you connect to your VM, you'll see a warning about the host's authenticity. This is normal and expected because it's your first connection to this server. Type <code>yes</code> to continue.
        </div>
        
        <details>
            <summary>What's happening with this warning?</summary>
            <p>SSH uses a trust-on-first-use model. When you connect to a new server, SSH can't verify that the server is actually who it claims to be. By accepting the warning, you're telling SSH to trust this server in the future.</p>
            <p>The server's fingerprint will be saved to your known_hosts file, and SSH will verify this fingerprint on future connections to ensure you're connecting to the same server.</p>
        </details>

        <h3>Understanding the Login Process</h3>
        <p>When you use SSH with a key file:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>SSH uses your private key to authenticate with the server</li>
            <li>If the server has the matching public key (which Oracle Cloud sets up automatically), you're granted access</li>
            <li>No password is needed because the key authentication is sufficient</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>You're logging in as the <code>ubuntu</code> user, which is a regular user with sudo privileges. This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can run administrative commands by prefixing them with <code>sudo</code></li>
            <li>You're not logging in as the root user (which is more secure)</li>
            <li>Your home directory is <code>/home/ubuntu</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Successful Connection</h3>
        <p>After connecting, you should see a welcome message from the Ubuntu system and a command prompt that looks something like:</p>
        <pre>ubuntu@instance-name:~$</pre>
        
        <p>This indicates you're successfully connected and ready to proceed with the next steps.</p>
        
        <!-- Placeholder for screenshot -->
        <div class="note">
            <strong>Expected Output:</strong> After connecting, you'll see the SSH fingerprint warning (which you should accept by typing <code>yes</code>), followed by the Ubuntu welcome message showing system information like this:
        </div>
        
        <pre>
The authenticity of host '64.181.202.3 (64.181.202.3)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:10Zf611345ENpBHc/8YQmvYHavJFGBHowH4t1wI1GLo.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '64.181.202.3' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
